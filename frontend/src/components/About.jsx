        <strong>SingSation</strong> is a karaoke-inspired sing-along lyrics app that lets users search for, view, save, and manage their favorite song lyrics. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The app includes registration, login/logout, user profile, favourites/playlist functionality for registered users, and an admin dashboard for managing user permissions, all wrapped in a glowing neon-style UI.
          It fetches lyrics from the open-source <code>lyrics.ovh</code> API and includes a link to listen to the songs on Spotify.
          </p>

        We built this app with love for ourselves and our friends to enjoy during get-togethers.
      It was a fun projectâ€”and we hope it brings fun to you, too!
